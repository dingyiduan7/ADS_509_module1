[Nicki Minaj, Angel De-Mar:]
Look, babe boy, you must got Nicki twisted
I woulda left before, but you insisted (Oh)
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core, I gotta leave you (Ooh)
How could you love me and humiliate me? (Humiliate me)
You ain't my man, don't affiliate me (Don't affiliate me)
With all your plans 'cause you really made me (Really made me)
A little bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days (Yeah)
From the slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money? It was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say (Ooh)
At night, I would sleep on you (Sleep on you)
And I guess I did sleep on you (Sleep on you)
'Cause when they said it, I said, "Creep on who?" (Uh-huh)
No, not my boo, ain't what he gon' do (Woo)
[Angel De-Mar:]
Oh, now you wanna be with me (Be with me)
But you can't be with me (Be with me)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta let you go
If you wanted me in your life (Me in your life)
Then you shoulda treated me right (Treated me right)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta let you go
[Nicki Minaj:]
Why you sayin' you ain't feel her? (Huh?)
You was in the villa (What?)
She was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin' on a Miller
My bitch Pam' (Kyuh) had the hidden cam like Killa (Woo)
Funny how you win some, you lose some (Ah-ha)
Never worry where your income would come from
'Cause no matter where you was, I held you down
Up north to uptown, so how you sound?
Now you all up in my face, 'bout, "You make mistakes" (Ah-ha)
If I'd've known you was fake, I'd've laced your steak (Uh-huh)
Strychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape
Quit lying, why you lying? (Why?) I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room (Room)
Give me some effin' room (Room)
Go get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned
Just like Usher, nigga, you gon' have to let it burn (Burn)
To the left and I ain't talkin' about Jigga girl (Woo)
[Angel De-Mar:]
Oh, now you wanna be with me (Be with me)
But you can't be with me (Be with me)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta let you go
If you wanted me in your life (Me in your life)
Then you shoulda treated me right (Treated me right)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta let you go
Yeah, yeah
I gotta let you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, oh
