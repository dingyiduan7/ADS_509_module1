As I sit back, relax, crack jokes for a minute
I think about the up-and-comers that could prolly get it
I might go to jail for fuckin' with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Maino life was like a movie (C'mon)
Set up the cameras, fuck him in the jacuzzi (My life is a movie)
Freekey Zekey, that should be easy, he just came home (Home)
I know he wanna bone (I know he wanna bone)
"But what about J.R. Writer?" I'ma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'ma grill him (Kyuh)
That nigga Pap, he might could fuck me (Fuck me)
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' no Gino Green (No Gino Green)
Tell Stack to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him, would he, would he yell, "Squad up?"
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy (Kyuh)
Throw some Ds on it (Uh-huh) and I might breathe on it (Okay)
And when I'm Philly, I gotta fuck Gillie (Ah-ha)
Snatch his big MAC and slap a bitch silly
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude

Put it in halfway, (Who?) Red Café
Put the pussy on his freckles (Ha-ha, that tickles)
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs, why's that?
I gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck (Oh, I get it)
As for Gravy, he might could beat (He might could beat)
You know them fat niggas love to eat (Love to eat)
And when I wanna Nicki Minaj, who could it be? (Yeah)
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
"Well, Nicki, what about Fendi? He made you pop" (I don't know)
Tell him to kick rocks (Kyuh) or give me some top (C'mon)
I'm on my way to Jers, break Ransom off
Quench his thirst when my pants come off
Murda Mook and Millz gon' have to battle (Uh-huh)
Scoop whoever win and tell 'em to skee-daddle (Kyuh)
Run up on Mims, he could give me back shots (Come here)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot, nigga
