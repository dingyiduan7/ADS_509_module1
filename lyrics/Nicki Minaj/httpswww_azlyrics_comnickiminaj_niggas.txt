This is for my niggas that did bids
All of my niggas that's doing time, for some shit that they ain't did
This is for my niggas that wild out
All of my niggas that ride out, all my niggas that hide out
This is for my niggas that buy weight
Niggas that leave on Monday, come back on a Friday
This is for my niggas that get high
All of my niggas that get by, all my niggas that get fly
This is for my niggas that cop dutches
All of my niggas throwing it up on them bikes and pop clutches
This is for my niggas that don't snitch
All of my niggas that don't bitch, all my niggas that tore fifths
This is for my niggas that don't cry
All of my niggas that don't smile, all my niggas that don't lie
This is for my niggas that take care
All of their kids order some bids, and take em to daycare
This is for my niggas that don't settle
All of my niggas that push pedals, all my niggas with gold medals
This is for my niggas that play ball
Niggas that wanna get in the game so they niggas can cake off
This is for my niggas that gave up
All of my niggas that's laid up and ya mind is made up
This is for the borough of Sean Bell (rest in peace)
All of my niggas with strong will, all my niggas that gone kill
This is for my niggas than stand up
All of my niggas that's gon' fight all my niggas that man up (C'mon)
This is for my niggas with big dreams
All of my niggas in sick jeans, that be spitting they sixteens
This is for the Tims and, this is for the Brims and
This is for the Trims and, this is for the rims and
This is for the kings and, this is for the bosses
This is for the blings and, niggas in the Porches
This one's for Malcolm, this one's for Martin
Wish I coulda thanks them, look what they started
This is 'cause I'm tired of losing (Tired of losing)
Even though my music is crack, guess I'm tired of using
It's like I'm tired of rapping it and I ain't even rapped yet
I'm tired and I'm asking am I ready for the rapture see
I'm just a little girl, caught in a mixed up world
Shout-out my girls that be calling me "sister girl"
A moment of silence
For all of this violence
For all of my mens that's locked in the pens
And trapped in the silence
[Angel De-Mar:]
I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you

[Nicki Minaj & Anel De-Mar:]
