You could smell the swagger off of the bitch, breh, you know what I mean?
You know, I personally don't think, you know, um
Any you other bitches could fuck with her, you know what I mean?
And no, don't take that shit to heart, uh, take it to your pussy
You know what I mean? 'Cause she gon' take it to your necks
And uh, who I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm talkin' 'bout Nicki Minaj, nigga, yeah, the Mistress
Yo, they be like, "Why she call herself 'The Mistress'?"
I be like, "I don't know"
And they be like, "I don't know, why she call herself 'Nicki Lewinsky'?"

And they be like, "Why you call yourself 'The President'?"
And, eh fuck y'all
