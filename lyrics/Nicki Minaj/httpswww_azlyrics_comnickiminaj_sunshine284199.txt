[Nicki Minaj, Gravy & Babyface:]
(Yeah, yeah! Sunshine!)
(Miss Nicki Minaj, my man Gravy)
(Dirty Money shit, let's go!)
Sunshine
Yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah
Go!
[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo! Yo yo yo yo, hold the do'
Let me get up on the float like Mardi Gras
Every-every time I rhyme, I sun the shine
Little mama, you a bird, like you done some time
Every-every time I spit, I massacre
So they better move quick, like Nascar
Everybody want a dime, I'm-I'm the best
When I get up in the club, I grind the best
You don't know, you better respect me
[?]
I wouldn't try it if it discredits Nicki
[?]
I am the one, like Tracy McGrady
Now little daddy let me, let me upgrade ya
Come on, I make it hot, see, I'm a hot one
I keep the stack and let Max play the shotgun (yes, sir)
I'm in the good car, always with a hood star
Introducing Mr. and Mrs. Good Bar
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup
Get up on my level niggas, get it up
Gettin' Dirty Money figures, throw it up
Get up on my level bitches, get it up
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup
[Gravy:]
It's frego daddy Gravy, of course
God Willing coming soon, I'm the good of New York
I shine like VVS stones in the dark
Take a seat when you hear me, like Rosa Parks
Fuck the chit chat
Let's talk guns and drugs, you with that?
Tryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than
Rollin' up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine
It's high noon and I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff
Me and Nicki's like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't be embarrassed
I'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage
But I still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret
'08 Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard
Turn it into a coupe, and now the roof's gone
Word to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on
See it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps, so move on
Before I act like a Autobot and transform
Too hot and I ain't Mims
I flip bricks while you little clown still buyin' rims
Who's in charge? Stop frontin' like I ain't him
I'm Saks Fifth Ave, you still shop at Fims
Superstar with the Audemar and a pair of Timbs
Who your wives screwing? Flossin', I been doin'
Fuckers
