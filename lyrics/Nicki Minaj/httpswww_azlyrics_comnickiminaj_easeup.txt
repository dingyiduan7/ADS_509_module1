And I don't know what they hate me for, I gets cake fo' sho'
And I don't know how to take it slow (Okay, uh)
I'm the type to get right, stay in the limelight (Kyuh)
These broke niggas always re-ing up
Nigga see me in the beam, now he speedin' up
I'm like "Duke, holla at me when ya Gs is up"
Oh, that's the Kanye piece? Throw your Jesus up
When I say I'm 'bout my guac, I don't mean amole
Feel like I'm being watched, I don't mean a Rollie (Okay)
I'm half past seven o' clock, all by my lonely (Kyuh)
Spits got the Dessie on cock, don't run up on me (Blocka!)
Bitches get mad, 'cause they know they can't (Stop her)
Nickname should be TV, the way they (Watch her)
Run with a (Shotter)
Gotta be at least six feet to break me off (Proper)

I'm at the bar gettin' Rémy on rocks
I'm comin' for these rap bitches if they ready or not (Kyuh)
You know the girl, I already was hot
You tell 'em, fuck a new bitch, I want a veteran spot
Look, it's Nicki M in the place, so stay back
I stay around the white like I'm Pat Sajak (Okay)
Plus I had my A-game up since 8-track
I'm Diddy with the flow, "Take that, take that"
My flow say ka-ching and my pockets say cheese
I ain't got a bag, but my wrists say freeze
Dick 'em, trick 'em, I know how to pick 'em
Brrt, stick 'em, ah-ha-ha! Stick 'em
[Nicki Minaj, Ru Spits:]
If you wanna me sweat me, then baby, let me tell you
I'm not like them other girls you've been with
'Cause I know you think I'm sexy, you wanna sex me
Rollin' with Ru Spits, we make hits, where my chips, bitch? (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
I don't know what you chasin', dog
'Cause I ain't got patience for (Nope, nope)
All these dudes that be hatin' y'all
'Cause money we be takin' more, gettin' cake for sure
Only think about makin' more
Grey Azzure, mink drag, let it scrape the floor
Don't be mad when I take your broad
Rock stones, can't trace a flaw
So I guess, in a way, you could say (You could say)
That I was made to ball
Act out and the K applaud
Me and Nicki gon' pay the cost
You wanna play the boss
You gon' learn how to take a loss
Of course I'm back, kid still torch the track
We gettin' paper like Office Max
Branch house with the horse to match
Pink gems, and the cross attached
Hit you, then I toss the gat
So, Gs up, nigga, get your Bs up
Chick act up, tell a hoe to ease up
In the back of the club, homie roll that weed up
If you wanna jump bad, a beatdown's the outcome
